Welcome to the codebase of YouTD 2!

## About
This is a standalone sequel to the popular WC3 custom map, YouTD. Developed with Godot 4 and infused with the love of hundreds of fans, this game has grown as an open-source project, just like the engine at its core.

Our goal is to develop a self-sustainable Tower Defense game that will grow with the help of the community. After finishing the core gameplay, we plan to implement a straightforward, automated mechanism for adding new towers, items, and builders to the game. This will allow the game to expand faster and maintain an open-sourced codebase.

Besides being a community-based game, it's still a great, well-balanced Tower Defense game with 1-6 hours of session-based gameplay, over 20,000 wave combinations, more than 700 towers, and an unlimited number of tactics to play with. Give it a go, and one day you might see your name in the game!
