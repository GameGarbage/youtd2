## Assets

The game repository doesn't contain assets. To be able to open the game in the editor, you will need to download the assets separately.

Link to assets folder: [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U4wTjBu2qo1cInH3IAowsFC5yq56V5uQ?usp=sharing)

(Note that these assets are partially replaced with placeholders)

Open this link and then follow these steps:

1. Download the whole folder.
2. Copy the contents of the downloaded folder.
3. Paste into 'assets' folder in the game repo.
4. You should see a popup asking whether you want to replace the files - press "Yes".
5. Open the Godot editor and make sure that all of the assets were loaded correctly.
