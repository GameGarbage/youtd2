Welcome,"Welcome to YouTD2!\nThis is the Hints menu where you can find basic information about the game as well as more advanced hints. To switch to a different section, select it on the left side of the window."
Camera Controls,Move the camera with WASD or by moving the mouse cursor to an edge of the screen.
Research Elements,"At the start of the game your first action should be to pick some elements and research them. You can do this by pressing on the Research button on the left side of the bottom bar. Then, click on one of the elements to research it. Researching elements unlocks new towers at the cost of Knowledge Tomes."
Knowledge Tomes,"[color=GOLD]Knowledge tomes[/color] is the currency which is used to research elements. You can see the current amount of knowledge tomes that you have on the right side of the bottom bar. You will earn more knowledge tomes every time you complete a wave."
Tower Stash,"[color=GOLD]Tower Stash[/color] is where your towers are stored. Tower Stash is located in the bottom bar, together with the [color=GOLD]item Stash[/color]. Tower Stash is split by elements of the towers. To switch to Tower Stash, press on one of the element buttons above the bottom bar."
Item Stash,"[color=GOLD]Item Stash[/color] is where your items are stored. Item Stash is located in the bottom bar, together with the [color=GOLD]Tower Stash[/color]. To switch to Item Stash, press on the backback button on the left side of the bottom bar."
Build Towers,"To [color=GOLD]build a tower[/color], open the Tower Stash and select one of the towers by clicking on it. Then move your mouse to the location in the world where you want to build. The tower preview will turn green when you have selected a valid build location. Click again to finish building."
Protect the Portal,"The main point of the game is to [color=GOLD]protect the portal[/color]. If a creep reaches the portal it will deal damage to it and once portal health reaches 0 the game is over. To prevent that, build towers so that they kill creeps before they reach the portal."
Gold,"[color=GOLD]Gold[/color] is the currency which you spend on building towers. Creeps will drop gold when they die. Gold can also come from other sources like items or tower abilities."
Income,"After each wave you will gain a gold bonus called [color=GOLD]Income[/color]. This extra gold amount is composed of two components: upkeep and interest. Upkeep depends on current wave level and will increase as the game progressed. Interest is calculated as a percentage of how much gold you currently have. The amount of upkeep and interest gained will be displayed on the left side of the screen after a wave."
Item drops,"Items will occasionally [color=GOLD]drop from creeps[/color] when they are killed. When this happens, the name of the item will popup above the creep and the item will automatically fly from the creep to your Item Stash. Items do not give any effects while they are stored in the Item Stash. To use an item, you either need to equip it on towers, apply it on a tower or consume it."
Equip Items,"To equip an item, switch to the Item Stash in the bottom bar. Then click on the item which you want to equip to start moving it. Click on a tower to equip the item to that tower. To unequip the item, select the tower, click on the item in Tower Inventory and click again on the ground."
Oil Items,"[color=GOLD]Oil items[/color] apply permanent effects to towers and cannot be removed once applied. To apply an oil item on a tower, click on the oil and then click on a tower. The oil will disappear from the stash after it's applied."
Consumable Items,"[color=GOLD]Consumable items[/color] give bonuses to the player and disappear after use, like Oil items. Click on a Consumable Item to use it."
Tower Positioning,"Many towers have aura's which provide benefits to other towers nearby. You should try to build towers [color=GOLD]next to each other[/color] to maximize the benefits of aura's."
Choosing Elements,"A particular element can be strong or weak against a creep type. Try to choose [color=GOLD]a diverse set of elements[/color] to make sure that your defenses are can deal well with all types of creeps."
Game Modes,"YouTD can be played in three game modes:\n \n[color=GOLD]Build Mode[/color]. Build towers and upgrade them. This mode is most similar to other Tower Defense games. It's recommended to play this mode only to learn the game because random modes are more fun.\n \n[color=GOLD]Random with upgrade[/color]. You receive random towers after each wave, based on the elements that you have researched. Note that all towers you receive will be from the first tier and need to be upgraded. You can replace towers to carry over permanent bonuses.\n \n[color=GOLD]Totally random[/color]. You receive totally random towers. Towers cannot be upgraded but you can replace towers to carry over permanent bonuses."
Tower Stats,"Towers in YouTD have some uncommon stats. Their mechanics will be explained here:\n\nBuff duration: Modifies the duration of buffs cast by this tower. For example, if a tower has a buff with 6 sec duration and it has 200% buff duration, the buff will last 12 sec.\n\nDebuff duration: Same as Buff duration but affects the duration of debuffs.\n\nTrigger Chances: Modifies the chances of chanced abilities. Example: Tower has a 20% chance to do something on kill and has 200% trigger chances => 40% chance.\n\nItem drop ratio: Creeps killed by this tower have a modified chance to drop an item. Example: Creep killed by a tower with 200% item drop ratio => doubled chance to drop item\n\nItem quality ratio: Creeps killed by this tower have a modified chance to get uncommon, rare and unique items. Example: Creep killed by a tower with 200% item quality ratio => doubled chance for uncommon, rare and unique items (if one drops)\n\nBounty ratio: Modifies the amount of bounty received for kills done by this tower."
Critical hit,"When towers make a critical hit, the attack will deal more damage than unusual. The base bonus is 50% more damage. Note that both normal attacks and spell damage can be critical."
Multicrit,"Towers can crit multiple times in the same attack which will cause the attack to deal extra damage. The maximum number of multicrits is determined by the tower's [color=GOLD]Multicrit[/color] stat.\n\nExample: A tower has 10% critical chance, 50% critical damage bonus and multicrit of 3. It has 10% chance to crit once and deal 1.5x normal damage. It then has 10%*10%=1% to crit a second time and deal 2x normal damage. And so up to a maximum of 3 crits. Note that only attack damage can multicrit, spell damage cannot."
Diminishing Returns,"Some tower stats are affected by [color=GOLD]Diminishing Returns[/color]. Such stats will get less effect from items, auras and other modifications once the stat goes [color=GOLD]above 170% or below 60%[/color]. This means that you should avoid stacking all of the bonuses for such stats on a single tower and try to spread the power around evenly to all of your towers. All of the stats in the Misc section in Tower Info are affected by Diminishing Returns:\n-Bounty ratio\n-Exp ratio\n-Item drop ratio\n-Item quality ratio\n-Trigger chances\n-Buff duration\n-Debuff duration"
