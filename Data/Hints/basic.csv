"Title","Text"
"Protect the portal","The main point of the game is to [color=GOLD]protect the portal[/color]. If a creep reaches the portal it will deal damage to it. Once portal health reaches 0 the game is over. To prevent that, build towers so that they kill creeps before they reach the portal."
"Income","After finishing a wave you will gain a gold bonus called [color=GOLD]Income[/color]. This extra gold amount is made up of two components: [color=GOLD]upkeep[/color] and [color=GOLD]interest[/color]. 
 
[color=GOLD]Upkeep[/color] depends on current wave level and will increase as the game progresses.
 
[color=GOLD]Interest[/color] is equal to [color=GOLD][0.05 * current gold][/color].
 
Both [color=GOLD]upkeep[/color] and [color=GOLD]interest[/color] rates can be increased with some rare items and abilities.
 
The amount of upkeep and interest gained will be displayed on the left side of the screen after a wave."
"Item drops","Items will occasionally [color=GOLD]drop from creeps[/color] when they are killed. When this happens, the item will automatically fly from the creep to your [color=GOLD]Item Stash[/color]."
"Equip Items","To equip an item, click on an item to start moving it. Then, click on a tower to equip the item to that tower.
 
To unequip the item, select the tower, click on the item inside the tower and click again on the ground."
"Oil Items","[color=GOLD]Oil items[/color] apply permanent effects to towers and cannot be removed once applied. To apply an oil item on a tower, click on the oil and then click on a tower. The oil will disappear from the stash after it's applied."
"Consumable Items","[color=GOLD]Consumable items[/color] give bonuses to the player and disappear after use, like Oil items. Click on a Consumable Item to use it."
"Tower Positioning","Many towers have aura's which provide benefits to other towers nearby. You should try to build towers [color=GOLD]next to each other[/color] to maximize the benefits of aura's."
"Choosing Elements","A particular element can be strong or weak against a creep type. Try to choose [color=GOLD]a diverse set of elements[/color] to make sure that your defenses are can deal well with all types of creeps."
"Game Modes","YouTD can be played in three game modes:\n \n[color=GOLD]Build Mode[/color]. Build towers and upgrade them. This mode is most similar to other Tower Defense games. It's recommended to play this mode only to learn the game because random modes are more fun.\n \n[color=GOLD]Random with upgrade[/color]. You receive random towers after each wave, based on the elements that you have researched. Note that all towers you receive will be from the first tier and need to be upgraded. You can replace towers to carry over permanent bonuses.\n \n[color=GOLD]Totally random[/color]. You receive totally random towers. Towers cannot be upgraded but you can replace towers to carry over permanent bonuses."
"Tower Stats","Towers in YouTD have some uncommon stats. Their mechanics will be explained here:\n\nBuff duration: Modifies the duration of buffs cast by this tower. For example, if a tower has a buff with 6 sec duration and it has 200% buff duration, the buff will last 12 sec.\n\nDebuff duration: Same as Buff duration but affects the duration of debuffs.\n\nTrigger Chances: Modifies the chances of chanced abilities. Example: Tower has a 20% chance to do something on kill and has 200% trigger chances => 40% chance.\n\nItem drop ratio: Creeps killed by this tower have a modified chance to drop an item. Example: Creep killed by a tower with 200% item drop ratio => doubled chance to drop item\n\nItem quality ratio: Creeps killed by this tower have a modified chance to get uncommon, rare and unique items. Example: Creep killed by a tower with 200% item quality ratio => doubled chance for uncommon, rare and unique items (if one drops)\n\nBounty ratio: Modifies the amount of bounty received for kills done by this tower."
"Critical hit","When towers make a critical hit, the attack will deal more damage than unusual. The base bonus is 50% more damage. Note that both normal attacks and spell damage can be critical."
"Multicrit","Towers can crit multiple times in the same attack which will cause the attack to deal extra damage. The maximum number of multicrits is determined by the tower's [color=GOLD]Multicrit[/color] stat.\n\nExample: A tower has 10% critical chance, 50% critical damage bonus and multicrit of 3. It has 10% chance to crit once and deal 1.5x normal damage. It then has 10%*10%=1% to crit a second time and deal 2x normal damage. And so up to a maximum of 3 crits. Note that only attack damage can multicrit, spell damage cannot."
"Diminishing Returns","Some tower stats are affected by [color=GOLD]Diminishing Returns[/color]. Such stats will get less effect from items, auras and other modifications once the stat goes [color=GOLD]above 170% or below 60%[/color]. This means that you should avoid stacking all of the bonuses for such stats on a single tower and try to spread the power around evenly to all of your towers. All of the stats in the Misc section in Tower Info are affected by Diminishing Returns:\n-Bounty ratio\n-Exp ratio\n-Item drop ratio\n-Item quality ratio\n-Trigger chances\n-Buff duration\n-Debuff duration"
"Tower Level","Towers gain experience when they kill creeps and once they get enough experience, their level increases. Leveling up increases the power of tower abilities and some items. In addition, all towers gain bonuses to the following stats when they level up: \n +0.15% crit chance\n +2% crit damage\n +0.15% spell crit chance\n +2% spell crit damage\n +4% base damage\n +1% attack speed"
"Horadric Cube","Horadric Cube allows you to transmute items into another item - useful when you got items you don't want. Items in the horadric cube must match one of the recipes, otherwise you won't be able to transmute them."
"Locking Items","Items can be locked, which will make the Horadric Cube ignore them when doing autofill. To lock an item, right click on it while holding Ctrl. This feature is useful to protect a powerful item from accidentally being transmuted."
"Attack Types","Towers have different attack types. Possible attack types are:
 
Physical, Decay, Energy, Essence, Elemental and Magic.
 
Each attack type deals different amounts of damage to armor types. Most attack types deal extra damage to some armor while dealing less to others. The exceptions are Essence and Magic attack types. In general, it is a good idea to build towers with diverse attack types.
 
You can check the stats of a tower's attack type by selecting the tower and then hovering over the attack type in the tower menu."
"Creep Specials","Each wave of creeps can have special abilities. You can see short names of wave specials in the Wave Status in the top right corner. Mouse over a wave special to see a description of it. You can also see creep's specials by selecting the creep."
"Carry towers","Usually, a single tower will tend to become more powerful than others and will get the majority of kills as a result. More kills means more experience and levels which will make that tower get even more powerful and get more kills. Such towers are called [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] towers.
 
It is a good idea to prioritize your [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] tower for oils, items and upgrades. For example, f you have a level [color=GOLD]15[/color] tower and a level [color=GOLD]2[/color] tower then the adding oils to level [color=GOLD]2[/color] tower is generally a bad idea."
"Support towers","[color=GOLD]Support[/color] towers are towers which do not provide as much firepower as [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] towers but have valuable abilities which empower other towers.
 
Such towers should be built strategically next to [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] towers to make them even more powerful.
 
[color=GOLD]Support[/color] towers can be useful even at low levels. If you can build a tower with a useful support ability and got food to spare, build it!"
"Leech from max levels","Towers continue to get experience from kills even after reaching the max level. There are items which transfer experience from one tower to another. Try to use such items on max level towers to distribute the extra experience."
"Tactical Items","Some items can be used tactically to give you a temporary advantage. For example, you can check the armor type of a future wave and swap in items which give a bonus against that armor type."
