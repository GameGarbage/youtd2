Pictures for tutorial.

Note that for consistency, these screenshots need to be taken at 1080p with 0.5 screen scale + scaled by 0.75 in image editor, so 0.375 scaling total.

Also, keep the width under 600 because tutorial window will not expand to fit images bigger than that. It's a problem with RichTextLabel.
